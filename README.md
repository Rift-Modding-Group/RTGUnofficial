- More config options.

## Development

Want to contribute? Great! Please read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/blob/1.10.2-master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.

* We currently have 5 mods under our belt, but RTG is the main focus, and the 1.7.10 version specifically is what we are currently need to be concentrating on and then forward-porting features to 1.8.9/1.9 (although we've strayed several times to work on the 1.9 version because it's new and exciting!)

* Check out the 'dev' branch for the newest changes. The master branch always gets 'frozen' immediately after we release a new version so that people can always build the most recent release from source if they want. Also, we use the 'etc' folder to store example configs, which reflect the latest release.

### Credits
----
This mod is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1281910-teds-world-gen-mods-realistic-world-gen-alpha-1-3) mod by ted80. It was created as a new project because it was expected to deviate from ted80's original vision for RWG, and the author of this mod didn't want to interfere with that vision.

RTG is brought to you by [Team RTG](https://github.com/Team-RTG) and contains a number of [contributions](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/graphs/contributors) from various members of the Minecraft modding community. It also uses KdotJPG's [OpenSimplex Noise](https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19) to generate its terrain.
